# Financial-Analysis-of-AtliQ-Hardware
This project was created to develop financial reports for AtliQ Hardwares. Excel's Power Query, Pivot Table, and Power Pivot are used in the creation of financial reports.
I have Prepared the following financial reports, namely:

   1. Customer Net Sales Performance 
 
   2. Market Performance vs Target
 
   3. Product Performance for the year 2020 
  
   4. P & L Values by Fiscal Year 
 
   5.  P & L Values by Months in 2019, 2020, and 2021

In this project, I accomplished the following tasks:

**Merging Data from Multiple Tables**: I combined data from various tables by using the VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP INDEX, & MATCH functions and used Conditional Formatting

**Statistical Analysis**: I performed statistical analysis, including calculations for mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and correlation.

**Data Modeling and DAX Measures**: I engaged in data modeling and created DAX measures within PowerPivot to enhance data analysis and reporting capabilities
